# Landsat8-Sentinel2-fusion-benchmark-dataset
We offered two datasets that can be potentially employed as standard datasets for Landsat8-Sentinel2 data fusion model assessment. The two datasets, ‘Hailar’ and ‘Dezhou’, contain 23 scenes and 24 scenes, respectively, and involve bands across visible, near infrared, and shortwave infrared ranges. Generally, the two datasets cover diverse landscapes (homogeneous land covers such as woodlands, heterogeneous land covers such as urban buildings) and reveal various surface dynamics (mild change such as forest phenological change, abrupt change such as crop harvesting activities), and thus they are ideal datasets used to assess the models under the scenarios across different levels of spatial and temporal variations.
